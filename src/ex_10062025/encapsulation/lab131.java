public class lab131 {
    // encapsulation
    // it is a fundamental concept in OOP
    // bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit
    // data members should be private in nature
    // methods with getter and setter only, you can access the data members/attributes
    // getter and setter -> help u to get or set the value via the methods only , not with
    // the reference
    // use getter and setter with condition to secure ur data members with methods
    // getter -> fetch the data member - secure this also
    // setter -> update the value - secure this also ( based on the condition)
    // ADVANTAGES---->>>>
    // 1. DATA HIDING
    // 2. INCREASE FLEXIBILITY: can make class read only or write only based on u
    // 3. SECURITY
